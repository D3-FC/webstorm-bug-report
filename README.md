Description of the problem:
--

Very nice to see support of `@` src alias. But very strange to see, that autoimport with this alias works not always.
For example: It works perfect in .ts files (https://i.imgur.com/587Mbve.gifv). But does not works in .vue files (https://i.imgur.com/gT0BLCq.gifv).


here is example:
